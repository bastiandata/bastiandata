I'm Bastian Roca, a commercial engineer with a strong background in financial analysis, digital marketing, e-commerce, and forensic consulting. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive informed business decisions.

Currently, I am a Forensics Consultant at EY, where I communicate findings to managers, design workflow improvements, and process and visualize client transactions using Power BI. I also optimize data processing with Python scripts and Alteryx workflows. I've contributed to over 8 projects across various sectors, including mining, construction, education, healthcare, real estate, and investments.

My academic background from the Universidad de Santiago de Chile in Commercial Engineering provided a strong foundation in economic analysis and quantitative methods.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, going to the gym, and playing football.
